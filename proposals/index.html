<h2>Proposals</h2>
<!---
<p>Submissions closed on Monday 2nd September.</p>
--->

<p>Submissions for the Conference open from Thursday 1 August 2025, and will close on Monday 2 September 2025 at midnight Australian Eastern Standard Time.</p> 
<!---
Please use the Google form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesQHSwfw7CA5zWOW5exjYkMPFg2aoTi17sHrcWbppYWtN0Qg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a> to submit. 
--->

<p>We will accept submissions in the following categories:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lightning talks</b> - A 5-minute talk focused on a single topic. It could be an empirical talk, a research idea, and an opportunity to raise issues for future discussion in the breaks. To be presented in "Lightning Panel" groups.</li>
<li><b>Mini-note</b> - A 15-minute talk, typically focused on empirical work. As much as possible, we will group mini-note speakers with researchers in similar areas.</li>
<li><b>Workshops</b> - A 1-hour session, typically led by one or two people who can give guided instruction and training on a particular topic (e.g., open research practices, new research methods, github, R).</li>
<li><b>Hackathons</b> - A 1-hour session where leaders coordinate a focused, hands-on project with a clear end goal (e.g., building an R package; curriculum development; working through ideas for research projects). Attendees at hackathons will typically have an opportunity to continue with the project beyond the Conference (often resulting in a publication), but there is no expectation of on-going involvement.  </li>
<li><b>Discussion groups</b> - A 1-hour session, typically led by one or two people who facilitate a general discussion on a particular topic (e.g., challenges to adopting open science practices; applying commercial determinants of health theory and methods to other areas). This can be a loosely formed idea, but itâ€™s a good opportunity to brainstorm your ideas and develop them further.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation:</h3>

<li><b>Title</b>: As brief as possible but long enough to clearly indicate the nature of the submission. Maximum of 110 characters (14 words).</li>
<li><b>Abstract/description</b>: Maximum of 1600 characters (approx. 200 words).</li>
<li><b>Workshops/Hackathons/Discussion</b>: Should include relevant information including connection to the Conference theme, aims of the Workshop/Hackathon/Discussion, and how participants will be involved.</li>
<li>References are not required. If you wish to include them, they must be included in the body of your text and included in the character count.</li>
<li><b>Do not include tables or figures.</b></li>
